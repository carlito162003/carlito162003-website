		<!--ABOUT-ME-PARAGRAH-->
<center>
		<p> I like to make digital and physical drawings, sketches, animations, <br>
			and many more. I enjoy exploring innovative programs and things<br>
			outside of my comfort zone. You can look at my content on the social<br>
			page that is linked somewhere in this site. I am into surreal <br>
			aesthetics and creepy imagery. Something about those videos, and <br>
			pictures just fascinate me; They inspire me to get into new topics<br>
			and make new artwork. I always try to make new projects but always<br>
			end up scrapping them. Thank you for reading this. </p>
